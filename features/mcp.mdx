## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a standardized way for AI agents to interact with external systems. MCP servers act as bridges between your agent and various services, enabling your AI to:

- **Access external data sources** - Connect to databases, file systems, cloud storage, and APIs
- **Integrate with platforms** - Work with GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, Notion, and more
- **Execute system operations** - Run commands, query databases, manipulate files
- **Maintain context** - Keep consistent access to resources across conversations

Think of MCP as a universal adapter that lets your agent plug into virtually any service or data source through a standardized interface.

## Setup MCP Tab View

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to MCP Tab View">
    Go to **Tools & MCP Page** to view and manage your connected servers.

    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/mcp-view-dark.png" alt="MCP servers interface" style={{ width:"99%", borderRadius: "8px", border: "1px solid #e7e5e4", margin: "10px" }} />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a New Server">
    Click **Add Server** and configure your MCP connection:

    <img className="dark:hidden mx-auto" src="/images/mcp-form-light.png" alt="Add MCP server form" style={{ width:"99%", borderRadius: "8px", border: "1px solid #e7e5e4", margin: "10px" }} />
    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/mcp-form-dark.png" alt="Add MCP server form" style={{ width:"99%", borderRadius: "8px", border: "1px solid #e7e5e4", margin: "10px" }} />


  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable for Projects">
    Once added, enable the MCP server for specific projects where you want your agent to have access to its capabilities.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Connection">
    Start a conversation with your agent and ask it to use the connected service:

    <img className="dark:hidden mx-auto" src="/images/chat-light.png" alt="Testing MCP in chat" style={{ width:"99%", borderRadius: "8px", border: "1px solid #e7e5e4", margin: "10px" }} />
    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/chat-dark.png" alt="Testing MCP in chat" style={{ width:"99%", borderRadius: "8px", border: "1px solid #e7e5e4", margin: "10px" }} />

    Your agent will automatically use MCP tools when relevant to the conversation.
  </Step>

## Using MCP Servers

### Via UI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Servers">
    Navigate to **Tools & MCP Page** and add the servers you need.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable for Projects">
    Select which projects should have access to each MCP server.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Chat Naturally">
    Your agent will automatically use MCP resources when they're relevant to your conversation. No special commands needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Activity">
    Use the **Sources** tab to see which MCP servers were called and what data was accessed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Via API

You can programmatically manage MCP servers through the API.

Check the [MCP API Reference](/api-reference/mcp/add-server) for detailed documentation on:
- Adding and removing servers
- Managing server configurations
- Enabling servers for projects
- Monitoring server status

The AI automatically determines when to use MCP resources based on the conversation context and available server capabilities.
