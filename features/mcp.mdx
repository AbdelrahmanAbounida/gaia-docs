# MCP Integration

Connect to [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers to extend your agents.

## What is MCP?

MCP lets AI agents interact with external systems through a standardized protocol. Think of it as giving your agent access to tools and data from other services.

## Available MCP Servers

Popular MCP servers:
- **GitHub** - Repository access
- **Slack** - Message and channel operations
- **Google Drive** - File management
- **PostgreSQL** - Database queries
- [Browse more on MCP Hub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

## Connecting MCP Servers

### Via UI
1. Go to Settings → MCP Servers
2. Click "Add Server"
3. Enter server details:
   - Name
   - Command to run (e.g., `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`)
   - Environment variables (API keys, etc.)
4. Save and enable for your projects

### Via API
```typescript
POST /api/mcp/add-server
{
  "name": "GitHub",
  "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github",
  "env": {
    "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_..."
  }
}
```

## Using MCP Tools

Once connected, MCP tools appear in your agent's available tools. The AI automatically uses them when needed.

See [API Reference](/api-reference/mcp/add-server) for details.
