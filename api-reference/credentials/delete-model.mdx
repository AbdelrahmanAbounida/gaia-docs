## Notes

<Info>
  This endpoint is **specifically for Ollama credentials** that manage multiple models.
</Info>

- When the last model is removed, the entire credential is automatically deleted
- This operation is only valid for Ollama provider credentials
- Attempting to use this on non-Ollama credentials will return a 400 error
- Model names must match exactly (case-sensitive)

## Behavior

1. If the credential has multiple models, the specified model is removed
2. If the credential has only one model (the one being deleted), the entire credential is deleted
3. The response message indicates which action was taken
