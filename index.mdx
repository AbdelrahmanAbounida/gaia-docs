## What is GAIA AI?

GAIA AI is a powerful and flexible **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework** for building intelligent AI agents. It enables you to combine structured & unstructured knowledge, external tools and APIs, MCP-based integrations, and local or hosted AI models—all in one modular, developer-friendly platform.

Whether you're building customer support bots, research assistants, or enterprise knowledge systems, GAIA AI gives you full control.
