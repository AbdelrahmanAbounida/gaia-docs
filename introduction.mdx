## Key Features

Everything you need to build production-grade AI agents:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="brain" title="10+ LLM Providers">
    Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, and more with a unified API interface. Switch between providers seamlessly without changing your code.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion icon="database" title="8+ Vector Stores">
  Integrate with Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, Qdrant, FAISS, and other
  vectorstores for powerful semantic search and RAG capabilities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="wrench" title="Custom Tools">
  Build and register your own agent tools. Use OpenAI function calling or create
  custom tool implementations to extend your agent's capabilities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="plug" title="MCP Integration">
  Extend your agents with Model Context Protocol. Connect to external tools,
  APIs, and data sources to give your agents superpowers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="images" title="Multimodal Support">
  Generate and process text, images, and audio. Build agents that understand and
  create content across multiple modalities.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="search" title="Hybrid Search">
    Combine vector search with lexical search engines like FlexSearch, MiniSearch, and TF-IDF for optimal retrieval accuracy.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

GAIA is built for every team and use case:
